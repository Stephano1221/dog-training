# Database
A dog training booking application created for A-Levels.

Teachers can create quizzes and add different questions to them, such as single-choice,
multiple-choice, or drag-and-drop. Students can take quizzes, where they will get immediate
feedback after each question, as well as their total score and percentage at the end of the quiz.

A leaderboard allows teachers to see the scores of all students who have taken a quiz, and sort
them by score or date.
